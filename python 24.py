#Tuples in python
#Tuples are immutable
#tuples cant be change(as it canbe change in list)
# tup1=(1,5,3,6,343,8)

# print(tup2[2])

# print(len(tup1))
# print(len(tup2))

# if 343 in tup1:
#     print("Yes 343 is present in this tuple")

#     print("No")  

# if 345 in tup1:
#     print("Yes 343 is present in this tuple")
# else:
#     print("No")    

#difference between tuples and integer
